## Abstract
This study explores the controlled modulation of human cognitive and emotional states using short-range software-defined radio (SDR) transmissions. By encoding frequency-specific waveforms corresponding to archetypal psycho-emotional states, we observed measurable responses in neurophysiological markers. Preliminary findings suggest potential applications in localized cognitive modulation, sleep-state alignment, and behavioral influence within controlled environments.

## Introduction
Recent advances in software-defined radio (SDR) have enabled precise, low-power transmission of electromagnetic signals within controlled environments. Previous studies in neurophysiological modulation and binaural audio research (e.g., Hemi-Sync protocols) suggest that specific frequency patterns may influence cognitive and emotional states. 

This research investigates whether short-range RF emissions, mapped to Jungian archetypes, can induce measurable effects in test subjects under strictly controlled laboratory conditions.

## Discussion
Controlled short-range RF emissions show measurable effects on targeted cognitive states. The data support repeatable associations between frequency/archetype pairs and physiological responses.  

- Sleep-state alignment for operational readiness  
- Behavioral conditioning under controlled constraints  
- Cognitive enhancement during high-stress tasks  

**Limitations:**  
- Small sample size  
- Environmental variability  
- Ethical constraints on long-term modulation  

**Ethical Considerations:**  
- Cognitive modulation carries psychological risks  
- Informed consent and debriefing required  
- Long-term exposure untested
